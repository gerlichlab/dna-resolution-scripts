## Local_separation_along_linescan
The script needs linescans in csv format. Linescans were  generated with the imageJ macro "allProfils.ijm". Linescans need to have at least the column Distance, Hoechst and f-ara-EdU.
File directory can be choosen in the block under the import block.
The Script reads the csv file and applies a z-standardization.
